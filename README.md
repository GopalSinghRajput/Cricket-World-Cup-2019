# Cricket Player Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict cricket player performance using machine learning techniques. Cricket is a sport with a rich history of statistics, and predicting player performance can provide valuable insights for team management, fantasy cricket enthusiasts, and cricket analytics.

In this project, we explore the Cricket World Cup 2019 Players dataset, preprocess the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance. The primary goal is to develop accurate models that predict cricket player performance metrics, such as runs scored, wickets taken, batting average, and more.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source**: [Cricket World Cup 2019 Players Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saivamshi/cricket-world-cup-2019-players-data)
- **Dataset Description**: The dataset contains detailed information about players who participated in the Cricket World Cup 2019, including batting and bowling statistics, personal details, and performance metrics.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into its structure, distributions, and key attributes.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering as necessary.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement various machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification) to predict player performance metrics.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) and cross-validation techniques to assess their accuracy and generalization capabilities.

- **Predictions**: Use the trained models to make predictions on player performance for upcoming matches or tournaments.
